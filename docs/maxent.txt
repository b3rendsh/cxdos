MAXENT: DOS1 FAT16 enhancement
==============================

Implementation of internal 16-bit maximum root directory entry variable which replaces the 8-bit variable.
The new maximum root directory entry value is 0x0FFF (4095) because maximum directory sectors is 256.
(256 x 512 sectorsize / 32 direntry size = 4096)

Backward compatible with existing DOS1 drivers / disksystem.

Command.com may show a cosmetic error with the DIR command:
The total number of files is modulo 256 (e.g. for 266 files, total displayed is 10),
on a FAT16 drive with exactly 256 or 512 entries then "File not found" is displayed.

Changes in FCB structure
------------------------
Offset 0x18 DEVID:
    if value >= 0x80 then DEVID else high byte of DIRLOC.
    bit 7 remains device flag and bit 6 remains disk file changed flag.
    
DEVID doesn't exist in DOS 2 FCB's and therefore minimal chances of new incompatibility.


Changes in internal kernel / data structures 
--------------------------------------------

The BPB is extended with 2 bytes:
Offset 0x0B: if 0 then MAXENT16 is used
Offset 0x15: 16-bit MAXENT16 value (max. 0x0FFF)

Kernel subroutines:
Parameter directory entry in register A replaced by register HL.
Hooks H.GETE, H.NEXT and maybe other DOS hooks affected.

System variables:
SPRTBUF (0xF1C9) jumps to 16-byte PRTBUF routine which is relocated, so 13 bytes can be used for new variables
LASTEN (0xF2B8) replaced by LASTEN16 (0xF1CC)
ENTFRE (0xF2FE) replaced by ENTFRE16 (0xF1CE)
SRCHLO (0xF30B) replaced by SRCHLO16 (0xF1D0)
LASTEN, ENTFRE and SRCHLO are used for invalid flag (0xFF=invalid or 0x00=valid)
